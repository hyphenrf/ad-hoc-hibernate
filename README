*** ALL IS FUCKED ***

And so, you are one log message away from punching your screen in.
Something in the whole stack of power management is leaky and you just want to
hibernate the damn thing. Maybe you have a laptop with a weak battery and you
don't want to lose your work. Maybe the power is out and the backup power
brick for your tower is about to run out of juice. Whatever it is, you want to
hibernate. And you want to run hibernate it *fast*.

Enter ad-hoc hibernate. A dead-simple C file that interfaces directly with
sysfs. You compile it and SUID (because SUID doesn't work on scripts), and
forget about it.. Until you need it.

```
$ hb
```

This is all you need to run, and as long as you set up your hibernation
correctly, it'll do its magic. 
(it will just save you time and effort writing `echo disk >/sys/power/state`)

Just to be EXTRA clear. This only works if you had at some point working
hibernation setup (think, swapfile or swap partition). It's an ad-hoc fix
until you debug and figure out what's wrong with logind or whatever broken
systemd meme you're using and patch it. It is not meant to be an actual power
management solution. OK? OK.
