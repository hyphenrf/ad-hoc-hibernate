To install, run `make`, then `make install` as a privileged user.

By default the resulting executable will be installed with MODE=4750:
```
rwsr-x---		root		wheel
```
and will be located in PREFIX=/usr/local/bin

You can, as root, change that later. But if you want to specify another group
(not wheel) during install, the option to that is called SETGROUP
```
make install SETGROUP=adm
```
for example.
